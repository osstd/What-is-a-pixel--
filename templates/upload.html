            * It's important to clarify that no images are collected or stored on
            the server during runtime. When you upload an image, the processing occurs in real-time on the server. The
            processing function extracts RGB values, which are then passed to the function responsible for rendering
            the results page.
            The data points derived from the processing are embedded directly in the HTML and used exclusively by your
            browser to plot the three charts you see. Importantly, once you refresh the page, all data is automatically
            and permanently erased.
